# Stock-Market-Prediction:
Stock market price data is generated in huge volume and it changes every second. Stock market is a complex and challenging system where people will either gain money or lose 
their entire life savings. Stock price prediction is very important as it is used by most of the business people as well as common people.It is a chaos system.Building an accurate
model is difficult as variation in price depends on multiple factors such as news, social media data, fundamentals, production of the company,government bonds, historical price 
and countryâ€™s economics. Analysis of financial time series and prediction of future stock price values and future stock price movements have been an active area of research over 
a long period of time. In this project I have proposed ARIMA Model and a suite of Deep Learning based Regression Model(CNN) for the purpose of forecasting Tesla index values.
